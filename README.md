## Dependency 
 using external libraries: glfw, glew, stb
 ### GLFW
   it is used to create windows with OpenGL context, without this library, it is used to manage the user input and manage the openGL context
 ### GLEW
 it is used to help us to grab the openGL extension for us. Without these libraries, we can directly use the specifications in openGL.
 ### stb
 this library helps us to open the image and load it for us. It is mainly used to load the texture into our CPU.\
